        <p>No, we do not have real time inventory because we have thousands of different items. It would take years to provide an accurate inventory count on each item. We do try to keep the postings updated on the website if they are available, sometimes items may be out of stock and we do not have a record of that until a customer orders. Customer service does contact the customers ASAP when an item is out of stock either by phone call or email. We then update the website to show the item out of stock or remove it from the website.</p>
